#Coding and development tasks for the next three weeks of my
project:
1.Find a python code example that can be run on an environment other than Google Maps API and figure out how/where to run it without errors
1.Keep trying code like that until you can bring up a map and can create polygons on it 
1.Modify code to shade an area of my choice (and that I know where it is) other than The Bermuda Triangle
1.Modify expectations accordingly-- I may not be able to do this in the Google Maps website yet
1.DONE Found existing code base
